# 🌀 Déjà Vu in 3D Time (T-CST)

## Abstract  
In **Triangular-Coupled String Theory (T-CST)**, time is not linear but flows in **circular momentum**. This nonlinear behavior explains the cognitive phenomenon of **déjà vu**: the subconscious recognition of repeated experience, even when the conscious mind perceives the event for the first time.

## Core Principles  

1. **Time Circularity**  
   - Time can spiral forward into the future or backward into the past, not just move linearly.  

2. **Conscious Perception**  
   - The conscious mind is bound to a linear surface of the present, unable to track sudden temporal jumps.  

3. **Subconscious Continuity**  
   - The subconscious exists in deeper τ-layers of the **Time Ocean**, remaining stable across time shifts.  

4. **Déjà Vu Effect**  
   - When circular time loops occur, the subconscious detects the repetition and signals the conscious mind:  
     > “I have already seen this.”

## Implications  

- **Evidence of 3D Time** → Déjà vu demonstrates that time is multidimensional.  
- **Conscious vs Subconscious** → Different layers of mind interact differently with time flow.  
- **Bridge Between Physics & Mind** → Human cognition becomes an experimental probe for T-CST.

## Conclusion  

Déjà vu is not merely a psychological illusion — it is a **direct human experience of circular time flow**.  
In **T-CST**, it arises naturally from the **entanglement of conscious perception and subconscious continuity** within the **3D structure of time**.
